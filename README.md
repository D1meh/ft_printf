# printf

This is the project "ft_printf" of 42 school, where you have to reproduce the real printf function.
This code has been validated by the moulinette, the algorithm of the school that verifies every details and situations.

This code is pretty messed up when it comes to flags output and redirection.
It's not a great idea to copy it, because it's quite hard to understand it.
And to be honest, i don't really understand it either, i know what i've done but i couldn't explain why i did it and how it affects the final results.
But if you really want to copy it, go ahead, the rest is not that hard to understand. Just remember that copying codes and projects aren't the best way to learn.
